            Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born on July 7th. 1981. He stayed with his family of four people, his father - Pan Singh, his mother - Devaki Dev, and his elder sister in the city of Ranchi, Jharkhand. His father was a hard-working man who wanted his son to join government services. He had a tough childhood not financially but because he has studied hard to fulfil his father’s dream. But all of this has a side story where he practices with his school’s coach for bowl catching regularly. He studied in a school named DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir School located in Ranchi itself. By a couple of months, he became an excellent goalkeeper in his football team. This skill turned him into an excellent wicket keeper in cricket. </p1>
